5. GIT: Allows us to track changes in the source code
6. Github: A platform for collaborating and hosting repositories
7. Merge: Combining changes made in one branch to another
8. Merge Conflict: Happens when git automatically fixes an issue with two commits
9. Push: This occurs when changes made on a remote repository are uploaded to a local one
10. Pull: This occurs when changes made on a remote repository are downloaded and merged onto a local one
